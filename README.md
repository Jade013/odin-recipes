# Odin Recipes Project

This project is focused on applying HTML basics to create a simple recipe website. By completing this project, I will have demonstrated foundational skills in structuring web pages using HTML, including creating lists, links, and organizing content effectively. This serves as a practical exercise to reinforce my understanding of HTML and web development fundamentals.
